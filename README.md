# Playstore-Apps-Data-Analysis-Using-Python-SQL

This project aims on cleaning the dataset, analyze the given dataset and mining informational quality insights. This project also involves visualizing the data to better and easily understand trends and different categories.

This project helped me to understand how a real-world database is analyzed using SQL, how to get maximum available insights from the dataset, pre-process the data using Python for a better upcoming performance, how a structured query language helps us retrieve useful information from the database
