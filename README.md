# Playstore-Apps-Data-Analysis-Using-Python-SQL

**This project aims on cleaning the dataset, analyze the given dataset and mining informational quality insights. This project also involves visualizing the data to better and easily understand trends and different categories.

This project helped me to understand how a real-world database is analyzed using SQL, how to get maximum available insights from the dataset, pre-process the data using Python for a better upcoming performance, how a structured query language helps us retrieve useful information from the database**


Before Analyzing the data, Here are the top Bussiness question regarding which I wanted to Analyze the data. 

1 - Are there specific categories that tend to have higher-rated apps and a greater number of installations?

2 - Is there a correlation between app ratings and the number of installs? In other words, do apps with higher ratings tend to have more installs?

3 - How does the popularity (number of installs) of apps vary within specific categories? Are there categories where a few apps dominate the market?
